<body>
<p>Plants are really important for the planet and for all living things.</p> 
<p>Plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen from their leaves, which humans and other animals need to breathe.</p> 
<p>Living things need plants to live - they eat them and live in them. Plants help to clean water too.</p>
<p>Plants bring natural beauty to our living spaces. ... They've been proven to reduce stress so well that one glance at a plant lowers your heart rate.</p> 
<p>They also help clean the air we breathe by absorbing toxins and acting as little oxygen factories. Plants simply make us feel better.<p>
